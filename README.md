Hey Duwamish!
===========
For a brief summary, please view: [http://smartercleanup.org/](http://smartercleanup.org/)

Our goal is to build a geography based community monitoring platform. An excellent example was put together by the GarageLab collective for the [Riachuelo river cleanup in Buenos Aires, Argentina](http://quepasariachuelo.org.ar/)

Local Setup
-------------
Hey Duwamish! requires python2.6 or greater.

Install `pip` and `virtualenv`, if not already installed. These will keep your python code isolated from the rest of your machine and ensure you have the correct versions.

```
easy_install pip
pip install virtualenv
```
You may need to use `sudo`to install these tools.

```
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install virtualenv
```
Create a new virtual environment inside of the repository folder, and install the project requirements:

```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
NOTE: If you run into trouble with gevent, you can safely comment it out of the requirements.txt file. It is not needed for local development. To comment it out, just add a hash "`#`" to the beginning of the line for `gevent`.

NOTE: If you have trouble with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, you may need to install the Python development libraries (for Python.h). The Windows installation has them by default, but some UNIX-based systems with a pre-installed Python may not. On such systems, you may need to run `sudo apt-get install python-dev` or download a fresh installer from python.org.

NOTE: Mac OS X users need a command line C/C++ compiler in place for the above steps to work. This can be done by downloading Xcode from the App Store and then installing the Command Line Tools via Xcode's Preferences > Downloads area.

Next, create a file under `src/.env` that will be used for loading your Shareabouts environment variables:

```
DUWAMISH_SITE_KEY='abcd'
DUWAMISH_SITE_URL='http://example.com'
```

To run the development server:

```
src/manage.py runserver
```
The server will, by default, be started at http://localhost:8000/. It is already configured for Hey Duwamish! but [here is the documentation](https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts/blob/master/doc/CONFIG.md) if you want to configure it.

NOTE: If you're new to programming with virtualenv, be sure to remember to activate your virtual environment every time you start a new terminal session:

```
source env/bin/activate
```
